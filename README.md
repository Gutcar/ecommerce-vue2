# DEPRECATED!!!

Proyect meant to be a example of the font-end for a eCommerce. Dons't run anymore due to deprecated tech stack, so its just a code example.

### Tech Stack
- Axios: "0.23.0",
- Vue: "2.6.11",
- Vue Router: "3.2.0",
- Vuex: "3.4.0"

## Run in legacy mode

Vue 2 is no longer supported but that can be bypassed easily by enabling legacy mode in the Node options


#### Turn on legacy mode for running the project
```sh
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

#### The legacy mode HAVE TO be turn off manually later by the developer
```sh
unset NODE_OPTIONS
```

> Use gitbash or smth like that
